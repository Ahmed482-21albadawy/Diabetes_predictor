# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction with Deep Learning

This project is a **Deep Learning model** that predicts the likelihood of a person having **Diabetes** based on their medical data.  
It was developed in **Python** using **TensorFlow/Keras**, along with **Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- End-to-end pipeline with **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.
- Built with a **Neural Network architecture** (Dense layers with activation functions, dropout, etc.).
- Trains on a diabetes dataset and predicts **binary outcomes**:  
  - `0 = No Diabetes`  
  - `1 = Diabetes`
